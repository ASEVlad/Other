13.
'Do you know any alternatives to the LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) and what is the difference between them?
Can you propose any solution for cold start problem in recommender systems?
What is the difference between modern one-stage and two-stage object detection systems?
Why does the attention mechanism in sequence to sequence models get better performance? Does attention help encoder or decoder more?'
14. One need to understand: where logistic regression is more acceptable than SVM. Or, when simple extrapolation is more effective than prediction methods, such as ARIMA or Holt-Winters.
